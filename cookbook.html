		<h1>Turkey Soup With Lime and Chile</h1></a>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<div class="content">
			2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
			1 cup diced onion <br>
			1 cup diced celery <br>
			1 cup diced carrot <br>
			½ teaspoon cumin seed <br> 
			½ teaspoon coriander seed <br>
			½ teaspoon black peppercorns <br>
			6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped <br>
			1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches long Cayenne <br>
			2 teaspoons salt, or to taste <br>
			8 cups unsalted turkey or chicken broth Vegetable oil for frying (about 1 cup) <br>
			4 corn tortillas, at least a day old, cut in 1/2-inch strips <br>
			4 to 6 cups cooked turkey meat, shredded <br>
			1 or 2 firm-ripe avocados <br>
			6 scallions, chopped <br>
			2 jalapeños, thinly sliced <br>
			1 small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped <br>
			 Lime wedges <br>
			</div>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<div class="content">
			Prep/Cook Time - 1 h <br>
			Serves - 4-6 <br>
			<br>
			Heat vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery and carrot and let soften, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.<br><br>

			Toast the cumin, coriander and peppercorns in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute, then grind in a spice mill or mortar. Add the ground spices to the pot, along with the garlic, cinnamon, a pinch of cayenne and salt.<br><br>

			Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce to a brisk simmer. Cook for 15 minutes, then taste for salt and adjust. Keep hot, covered, over very low heat.<br><br>

			Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 1/2 inch into a wide skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and looks wavy, add the tortilla strips and fry until barely colored, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle lightly with salt. (The oil may be strained and saved for future frying.)<br><br>

			In a medium saucepan, heat the shredded turkey meat with a little of the hot soup. Divide the meat among 4 to 6 soup bowls and add a few slices of avocado to each. Ladle about 1 cup soup into each bowl, then garnish with tortilla strips, scallions, jalapeño slices, chopped cilantro and a generous squeeze of lime juice.
